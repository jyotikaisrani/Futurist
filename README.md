Humans are not born to be still, people shift around, get closer to the camera for a better look, and it is hard to keep our heads in one place. In order to accurately determine muscle movement from image data, we not only needed to normalize all our measurements, but we also needed to make design considerations that would incentivize the user to hold still and face into the camera for the entirety of the exercise. And we were unable to get accurate results for drooling face which is also a symptom of Bell's Palsy. For the hand training exercises, it was not easy to detect and train hands and we didn't have appropriate data.
